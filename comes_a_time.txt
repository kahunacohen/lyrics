[G]Comes a time [Bm]when you're driftin'
[D]Comes a time when you s[Am7]ettle down
[G]Comes a light, [Bm]feelings liftin'
[D]Lift that baby right up [Am7]off the ground

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder, tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time
{end_of_chorus}

You and I, we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
That's how we kept what we gave away

{chorus x2}

[G]There comes a [Dm7]time
There comes a [G]time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
