[G]Brave men fall with a [F]battle cry
[C]Tears fill the eyes of their [C]loved ones
And their [Csus]brothers in [G]arms
So it [F]went, for Joseph Warr[C]en

It should have been different
It could have been easy
His rank could have saved him
But a country unborn needs bravery
And it spread like wildfire

{start_of_chorus}
Wildfire
{end_of_chorus}

From the ashes grew sweet liberty
Like the seeds of the pines when the forest burns
They open up, grow and burn again
It should have been different
It could have been easy
But too much money rolled in
To ever end slavery
The cry for war spread like wildfire

{chorus}

Civil War came, Civil War went
Brother fought brother, the South was spent
But it's true demise was hatred
Passed down through the years
It should have been different
It could have been easy
But pride has a way of holding too firm to history
And it burns like wildfire

{chorus}

I was born a southern son
In a small southern town where the rebels run wild
They beat their chest and they swear
We're gonna rise again
It should have been different
It could have been easy
The day that old Warren died
Hate should have gone with him
But here we are, caught in the wildfire

{chorus} x 4
