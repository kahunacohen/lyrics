[D]Well my buckle makes impressions
On the [A7sus]inside of her thigh
There are [G]little feathered Indians
Where we tussled through the night
If I'd [D]known she was religious
Then I [A7sus]wouldn't have came stoned
To the [G]house of such an angel
Too fucked up to get back home

[D]Lookin' over West Virginia
Smoking [A7sus]Spirits on the roof
She asked ain't [G]anybody told ya
That them things are bad for you
I said [D]many folks have warned me
There's been [A7sus]several people try
But up till [G]now, there ain't been nothing
That I couldn't leave behind

{start_of_chorus}
[A7]Hold me close my [G]dear
[A7]Sing your whispering [G]song
[A7]Softly in my [G]ear
And [A7]I will sing [G]along
Honey tell me how your [Bm]love [A]runs [G]true
And how I can [Bm]always count [A]on [G]you. [A7sus]
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd [G]run across the river just to hold you [D]tonight

Well my heart is sweating bullets
From the circles it has raced
Like a little feathered indian
Callin' out the clouds for rain
I'd go runnin' through the thicket
I'd go careless through the thorns
Just to hold her for a minute
Though it'd leave me wanting more

{chorus}
