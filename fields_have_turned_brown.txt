{title: The Fields Have Turned Brown}
{artist: Stanley Brothers}
{genre: folk}

I left my old [C]home to ramble this country
My mother and [F]dad said, "Son don't go [C]wrong
Remember that [F]God will always watch over [C]you
And we will be [G]waiting for you here at [C]home"

{start_of_chorus}
"Son, don't go [F]astray", was what they both [C]told me
"Remember that [G]love for God can be [C]found"
But now they're both [F]gone, this letter just [C]told me
For years they've been [G]dead, the fields have turned [C]brown
{end_of_chorus}

For many long years I've rambled this country
No thoughts of the day when I would return
Now as I go home to find no one waiting
The price I have paid to live and to learn

{chorus}
