{start_of_chorus}
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
{end_of_chorus}

It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

{chorus}

There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note

{chorus}

Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving' back some glares
To the people that you met
And it's your first cigarette

{chorus}

Now you say you're leaving' home
'Cause you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're finding' out it's real?

{chorus}
