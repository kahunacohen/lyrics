[G]Here I [D]stand [F]head in [G]hand
[C]Turn my face to the [F]wal[C]l
[G]If she's [D]gone I [F]can't go [G]on
[C]Feelin' two-foot [F]smal[C]l

[G]Every[D]where [F]people [G]stare
[C]Each and every [F]da[C]y
[G]I can [D]see them [F]laugh at [G]me
[C]And I hear them [F]saa[C]a[D]y

{start_of_chorus}
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
{end_of_chorus}

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

{chorus}
