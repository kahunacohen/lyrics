{start_of_chorus}
Four strong [C]winds that blow [Fm]lonely
[G7]Seven seas that run [C]high
All those things that don't [Fm]change come what [G7]may
But our [C]good times are all [Fm7]gone
And I'm [G7]bound for moving [C]on
[Fm7]I'll look for you if I'm [F]ever back this [G7]way
{end_of_chorus}

[C]Think I'll go out to Al[Fm]berta
Weather's [G7]good there in the [C]fall
I got some friends that I can [Fm]go to working [G7]for
Still I [C]wish you'd change your [Fm]mind
If I [G7]asked you one more [C]time
But we've [Fm7]been through that a [F]hundred times or [G7]more

{chorus}

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are goin' good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
There ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

{chorus}
