{start_of_chorus}
Four strong [G]winds that blow [Cm]lonely
[D7]Seven seas that run [G]high
All those things that don't [Cm]change come what [D7]may
But our [G]good times are all [Cm]gone
And I'm [D7]bound for moving [G]on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
{end_of_chorus}

Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I can go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

{chorus}

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are goin' good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
There ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

{chorus}
