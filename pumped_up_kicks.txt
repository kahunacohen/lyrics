[Em]Robert's got a quick [G]hand
He'll [D]look around the room he won't [A]tell you his plan
[Em]He's got a rolled cigarette
[D]Hanging out his mouth, he's a [A]cowboy kid

Yeah, he found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet, in a box of fun things
And I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

{start_of_chorus}
[Em]All the other kids with the [G]pumped up kicks
You better [D]run, better run, [A]outrun my gun
[Em]All the other kids with the [G]pumped up kicks
You better [D]run, better run [A]faster than my bullet

{end_of_chorus}

Daddy works a long day
He's coming home late, yeah, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say your hair's on fire
You must have lost your wits, yeah
