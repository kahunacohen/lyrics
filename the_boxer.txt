[C]I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom [Am]told
I have [G]squandered my resistance
For a [G7]pocketful of m[G6]umbles such are [C]promises

All lies and [Am]jest still a [G]man hears what he [F]wants to hear
And disregards the [C]rest.    [F][G][C]
 
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
 
{start_of_chorus}
[Am]Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-la-[Em]la-la lie-la-lie
Lie la [Am]lie
Lie-la [G]la la la la lie la la la la [C]lie
{end_of_chorus}

Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
 
Now the years are rolling by me, they are rocking evenly
And I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be, that's not unusual
No, it isn't strange, after changes upon changes we are more or less the same 
After changes we are more or less the same
 
{chorus}
 
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
 Leading me-e
Going home
 
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
"I am leaving, I am leaving." but the fighter still remains
Hm, hm, hm
 
{chorus}
