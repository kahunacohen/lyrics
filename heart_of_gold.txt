[Em]I want to [C]live
[D]I want to [G]give
[Em]I've been a [C]miner for a [D]heart of [G]gold
[Em]It's these [C]expressions
[D]I never [G]give
[EmThat keep me searching for a [G]heart of gold

[C]And I'm getting old
[Em]Keep me searching for a [G]heart of gold
[C]And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold

And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Em]Keep me searching for a [D]heart of [Em]gold
You keep me searching and I'm [D]growing [Em]old
Keep me searching for a [G]heart of gold
[C]And I'm getting old. [G]
