[D]              D            Bm7add11        Bm7add11
[D]My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
     Cadd9        Cadd9          G          G
And I, I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
D              D            Bm7add11        Bm7add11
  My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
     Cadd9        Cadd9          G          G
And I, I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark

  D                  D                C            C
I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
    Bm           Bm                Gm               Gm
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
   D                    D            C                 C
My dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
  G/B             G/B        Asus        A7
I said I have no way of feeding you, so leave
 
Cadd9              Cadd9          G             G
  But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
D                   D/C#       Bm7add11  Bm7add11
  And he gave it a ten dollar raise
Cadd9          Cadd9   G             G
  And when I needed my mother and I called her
D                  D/C#    Em    Em    A7sus   A7
  She stayed with me for days
 
    G                 G         Gm                Gm
Now someone's on the telephone, desperate in his pain
D                D/C#            Bm           Bm
Someone's on the bathroom floor, doing her cocaine
Cadd9              Cadd9         G             G
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
D              D/C#              F#7 N.C.
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom
        E7/G#   E7/G#             Gmaj7     Gmaj7
But I tried to make this place my place;    I asked for providence to
Cadd9       Cadd9             G N.C.
smile upon me with its sweet face;      Yeah, but I'll tell you:
 
D              D            Bm7add11        Bm7add11
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
     Cadd9        Cadd9          G          G
And I, I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
D              D            Bm7add11        Bm7add11
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
    Cadd9        Cadd9          G          G
And I, I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
 
  D                  D                C            C
Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
    Bm           Bm                Gm               Gm
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
   D                    D            C                 C
My greatest hope, my greatest cause to grieve
  G/B             G/B                   Asus        A7
And my heart flew from its cage, and it bled upon my sleeve
 
Cadd9              Cadd9          G             G
The cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
D                   D/C#       Bm7add11  Bm7add11
I couldn't hear them for the thunder
Cadd9          Cadd9                    G             G
I was half the naked distance between hell and heaven's ceiling
D        D/C#    Em    Em    A7sus   A7
And it almost pulled me under
 
    G                 G         Gm                Gm
Now someone's on the telephone, desperate in his pain
D                D/C#            Bm           Bm
Someone's on the bathroom floor, doing her cocaine
Cadd9              Cadd9         G             G
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
D              D/C#              F#7 N.C.
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom
        E7/G#   E7/G#             Gmaj7     Gmaj7
But I tried to make this place my place;    I asked for providence to
Cadd9       Cadd9             G N.C.
smile upon me with its sweet face;      Yeah, but I'll tell you:
 
D              D            Bm7add11        Bm7add11
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
     Cadd9        Cadd9          G          G
And I, I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
 
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
 
And I, I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
 
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
     Cadd9        Cadd9             G N.C.
And I, I do not feel the romance; I will not be a pawn
        Gm
For the prince of darkness any longer
