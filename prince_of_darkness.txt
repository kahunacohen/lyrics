{start_of_chorus}
[D]My place is of the sun and [Bm7]this place is of the dark
And [Cadd9]I, I do not feel the romance, [G]I do not catch the spark :| repeat 1x

[D]I don't know when I noticed [C]life was life at my expense
[Bm]The words of my heart lined up like [Gm]prisoners on a fence

[D]My dreams came in like needy children [C]tugging at my sleeve
[G/B]I said I have no way of [Asus]feeding you, so [A7]leave

[Cadd9]But there was a time I asked my [G]father for a dollar
[D]And he gave it a [D/C#]ten dollar [Bm7add11]raise
[Cadd9]And when I needed my [G]mother and I called her
[D]She stayed with [D/C#]me for days[A7sus]   [A7
 
[G]Now someone's on the telephone, [Gm]desperate in his pain
[D]Someone's on the [D/C#]bathroom floor, [Bm]doing her cocaine
[C/add9]Someone's got his finger on [G]the button in some room
[D]No one can [D/C#]convince me we aren't [F#7]gluttons for our doom
[E7/G#]But I tried to make this place my [Gmaj7]place;
I asked for providence to [Cadd9]smile upon me with its sweet [G]face;
Yeah, but I'll tell you:

[D]My place is of the sun and [Bm7]this place is of the dark
And [Cadd9]I, I do not feel the romance, [G]I do not catch the spark :| repeat 1x
 
Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope, my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage, and it bled upon my sleeve
The cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldn't hear them for the thunder
I was half the naked distance between hell and heaven's ceiling
And it almost pulled me under
 
Now someone's on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someone's on the bathroom floor, doing her cocaine
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom
But I tried to make this place my place;    I asked for providence to
smile upon me with its sweet face;
Yeah, but I'll tell you:
 
[D]My place is of the sun and [Bm7]this place is of the dark
And [Cadd9]I, I do not feel the romance, [G]I do not catch the spark :| repeat 1x

I will not be a pawn For the prince of [Gm]darkness any longer
