Peaches in the summertime
Apples in the fall
If I can't have the girl I love
I don't want none at all

{start_of_chorus}
Shady Grove, I know
Shady Grove, my little love
I'm bound for Shady Grove
{end_of_chorus}

I wish I had a banjo string
Made of golden twine
Every tune I'd play on it
I wish that girl was mine
Shady Grove, my little love

{chorus}

I wish I had a needle and thread
Fine as I could sew
I'd sew that pretty girl to my side
And down the road I'd go

{chorus}

Some come here to fiddle and dance
Some come here to tarry
Some come here to fiddle and dance
I come here to marry

{chorus}

Every night when I go home
Wife, I try to please her
The more I try, the worse she gets
Damned if I don't leave her

{chorus}

Shady Grove, my little love
Shady Grove, my darling
Shady Grove, my little love
I'm going back to Harlan

{chorus}
