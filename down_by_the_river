[Em]Be on my side. I'll [A]be on your side, baby.
[Em]There is no reason for [A]you to hide.
[Em]It's so hard for me [A]staying here all alone,
[Em]When you could be taking [A]me for a ride.

[C]She could drag me [Bm]over the rainbow,
[C]Send me [Bm]away.[D]

[G]Down [D]by the [A]river,
[G]I [D]shot my [A]baby.
Down by the river.
Dead, ooh, ooh, shot her dead, ooh.

You take my hand, I'll take your hand.
Together we may get away.
This much madness is too much sorrow.
It's impossible to make it today.
She could drag me over the rainbow,
Send me away.

Down by the river,
I shot my baby.
Down by the river.

Dead, dead, ooh, ooh, shot her dead, shot her dead.

Be on my side. I'll be on your side.
There is no reason for you to hide.
It's so hard for me staying here all alone,
When you could be taking me for a ride.

She could drag me over the rainbow,
Send me away.

Down by the river,
I shot my baby.
Down by the river
Down by the river,
I shot my baby.
Down by the river.

Down by the river,
I shot my baby.
Down by the river.
