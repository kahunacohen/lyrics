If I showed [Am]up [F]to your [C]wedding
Wearing [Dm]black and [Am]blue and [C]red
Wouldn't [Am]it [F]seem [C]fitting
Cause I'm as [Dm]bruised and [Am]angry as I've [C]ever been.

{start_of_chorus}
[G]There was a [Am]time when I [F]called you
[G]There was a [Am]time when I [F]called you [C]mine.
{end_of_chorus}

This old house is cold and empty
Even these old walls have been.I laid down.You're not with me.
Waking up just seems a sin.

{chorus}

[Am]There's no gold on either [Dm]side of the Mississipp[Am],
No [Dm]silver left [Am]in this world to [C]find.
Precious [Am]metal and [F]precious [C]memories
Slip [Dm]away, slip [Am]away from your [F]finger and your [C]mind.

{chorus}
